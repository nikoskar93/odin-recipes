   </h4>

   <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar </li> 
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste </li>
        <li>1 large cucumber </li> 
        <li>salt to taste </li>
        <li>1 (17.6 ounce) container full fat plain Greek yogurt </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together olive oil, vinegar, and garlic in a bowl and let sit while you prepare the cucumber.</li>
        <li>Peel cucumber and cut in half lengthways; scrape out all the seeds. Grate cucumber with a cheese grater into a sieve set over a bowl. 
            Sprinkle with salt. Strain out as much liquid as possible by pressing down in the sieve with the palm of your hand. 
            Alternately you can wring cucumber out in a clean tea towel. Add cucumber and yogurt to the garlic mixture. Mix until well 
            combined and season with salt to taste.</li>
